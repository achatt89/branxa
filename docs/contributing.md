# Contributing

## Workflow

1. create a focused branch
2. implement change with tests
3. run `npm run build` and `npm test`
4. update docs when interfaces or behavior change
5. open PR with clear scope and verification notes

## Coding expectations

- keep command interfaces stable unless intentionally versioned
- preserve deterministic behavior and explicit fallback messages
- add/adjust tests for every behavior change
- keep branding consistent as Branxa

## Documentation expectations

- keep `README.md` user-facing
- keep `docs/` developer-facing
- update `docs/SUMMARY.md` when adding pages
